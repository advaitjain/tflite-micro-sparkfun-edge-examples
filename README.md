This repository has TfLite Micro examples specialized for the Sparkfun Edge.

The primary purpose here is to prototype how examples may be supported on a
variety of targets without needing target-specific code to be added to the
upstream Tensorflow repository.

This particular repository is **not** intended to be a supported location for
Sparkfun Edge + TFLM integration.
